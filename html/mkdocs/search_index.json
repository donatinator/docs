To be able to do this, we need multiple members\nof the community to read, review, and comment on the proposal.\n\n\nThis process is intended to help reach consensus on any feature that would affect the core ability to accept both\nsingle and recurring donations.\n\n\nOnly by doing this can we ensure the best outcome for everyone using The Donatinator.\n\n\nWhen you need to follow this process\n\n\nYou need to follow this process if you intend to make changes to any of The Donatinators code or docs that result in a\nsignificant change or a backwards incompatible change. This may include some of the following though this list is not\nexhaustive:\n\n\n\n\nWhen changing web client code which helps accept donations.\n\n\nWhen calling a Stripe API that deals with any kind of charge and/or subscription.\n\n\nWhen performing a destructive database schema change.\n\n\n\n\nSome changes do not require an RFC and those may go through the regular pull request process. If a PR is deemed to be\nsignificant or backwards incompatible, then the issue may be closed with a polite request suggesting an RFC is raised\ninstead.\n\n\nGathering Feedback\n\n\nIt's often helpful to gather feedback before diving too deeply into your new concept, just in case someone knows how to\nsolve it with the current release or with a small easy patch. This can save time for all concerned.\n\n\nOnce you're convinced that this feature \nis\n required, it's also helpful to obtain feedback prior to submitting your\nRFC. You may open an issue in the \nRFC repo\n to start a high-level discussion,\nwith the goal of eventually opening an RFC pull request with all the details gathered together in one document.\n\n\nThe RFC Process\n\n\nThere is a pre-process (hinted at above) and then the process itself.\n\n\nAs hinted at above, you can perform initial data gathering, obtain feedback, and perform some analysis. You may create\nan issue so that everyone on the project can see it and help you gather what you need. This step is optional. You may\ngo straight into the process itself.\n\n\n\n\nFork the \nRFC repo\n repo\n\n\nCopy \nYYYYMMDD-template.md\n file to \n1-incoming/20170906-my-feature.md\n (fill in todays date and \nmy-feature\n\n  describes your feature in a few words)\n\n\nFill in the RFC. Put care into the details: \nRFCs that do not present convincing motivation, demonstrate\n  understanding of the impact of the design, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be\n  poorly-received\n.\n\n\nSubmit a pull request (with a 'Closes #nnn' of the issue number used for initial feedback).\n\n\nAs an RFC in the \nreviewing\n stage, it will be moved from \n1-incoming\n to \n2-reviewing\n under a new pull request for\n  discussion. It will now receive design feedback from the larger community. This PR will link back to the initial data\n  gathering ticket, as well as the pull request ticket.\n\n\nUnder the new \nreviewing\n issue, build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are much more\n  likely to make progress than those that don't receive any comments. The author should be prepared to revise their\n  pull request with additional commits in response to any feedback received.\n\n\nEventually, the core team will decide whether the RFC is a candidate for inclusion into The Donatinator.\n\n\nRFCs that are candidates for inclusion in The Donatinator will enter a \"final comment period\" lasting 7 days. The\n  beginning of this period will be signaled with a comment such as \"Final comment period.\" and label on the RFC's pull\n  request. Furthermore, \nThe Donatinator's official Twitter account\n will post a\n  tweet about the RFC to attract the community's attention.\n\n\nAn RFC can be modified based upon feedback from the core team and community. Significant modifications may trigger a\n  new final comment period.\n\n\nAn RFC may be rejected by the core team after public discussion has settled and comments have been made summarizing\n  the rationale for rejection. A member of the core team should then close the RFC's associated pull request.\n\n\nAn RFC may be accepted at the close of its final comment period. A core team member will merge the RFC's associated\n  pull request, at which point the RFC will become 'active'.\n\n\n\n\nIf accepted, the \nreviewing\n PR will be updated to move the RFC to \n3-accepted\n. If not it'll be moved to\n\n5-rejected\n. Once the RFC has been accepted, anyone (not just the original proposer) can start to implement it. If the RFC is being actively worked on, it'll stay in the \n3-accepted\n stage.\n\n\nThe RFC Life-Cycle\n\n\nOnce an RFC becomes active then authors may implement it and submit the feature as a pull request to\n\nThe Donatinator repo\n. Moving to the \naccepted\n state is not a rubber\nstamp, and in particular still does not mean the feature will ultimately be merged; it does mean that the core team has\nagreed to it in principle and are amenable to merging it.\n\n\nFurthermore, the fact that a given RFC has been accepted implies nothing about what priority is assigned to its\nimplementation, nor whether anybody is currently working on it. If you're interested, it is worth asking around to see\nif anybody has an active interest in the RFC at any level.\n\n\nModifications to accepted/in-progress RFC's can be done in followup PR's. We strive to write each RFC in a manner that\nit will reflect the final design of the feature; but the nature of the process means that we cannot expect every merged\nRFC to actually reflect what the end result will be at the time of the next major release; therefore we try to keep\neach RFC document somewhat in sync with the language feature as planned, tracking such changes via followup pull\nrequests to the document.\n\n\nImplementing an RFC\n\n\nThe author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the RFC author (like any other developer) is welcome\nto post an implementation for review after the RFC has been accepted.\n\n\nIf you are interested in working on the implementation for an 'active' RFC, but cannot determine if someone else is\nalready working on it, feel free to ask (e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue).\n\n\nReviewing RFC's\n\n\nAt regular intervals, the core team will attempt to review whatever is currently in the RFC repo. This may involve\nmoving things along, providing feedback, or rejecting them entirely.\n\n\nCredits\n\n\nThanks to the following projects for having RFC processes that we were able to build on for our own process:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs\n\n\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs\n\n\nhttps://github.com/emberjs/rfcs\n\n\n\n\n(Ends)",

When calling a Stripe API that deals with any kind of charge and/or subscription.  When performing a destructive database schema change.

You may create\nan issue so that everyone on the project can see it and help you gather what you need. This step is optional. You may\ngo straight into the process itself.   Fork the  RFC repo  repo  Copy  YYYYMMDD-template.md  file to  1-incoming/20170906-my-feature.md  (fill in todays date and  my-feature \n  describes your feature in a few words)  Fill in the RFC. Put care into the details:  RFCs that do not present convincing motivation, demonstrate\n  understanding of the impact of the design, or are disingenuous about the drawbacks or alternatives tend to be\n  poorly-received .  Submit a pull request (with a 'Closes #nnn' of the issue number used for initial feedback).  As an RFC in the  reviewing  stage, it will be moved from  1-incoming  to  2-reviewing  under a new pull request for\n  discussion. It will now receive design feedback from the larger community. This PR will link back to the initial data\n  gathering ticket, as well as the pull request ticket.  Under the new  reviewing  issue, build consensus and integrate feedback. RFCs that have broad support are much more\n  likely to make progress than those that don't receive any comments. The author should be prepared to revise their\n  pull request with additional commits in response to any feedback received.  Eventually, the core team will decide whether the RFC is a candidate for inclusion into The Donatinator.  RFCs that are candidates for inclusion in The Donatinator will enter a \"final comment period\" lasting 7 days. The\n  beginning of this period will be signaled with a comment such as \"Final comment period.\" and label on the RFC's pull\n  request. Furthermore,  The Donatinator's official Twitter account  will post a\n  tweet about the RFC to attract the community's attention.  An RFC can be modified based upon feedback from the core team and community. Significant modifications may trigger a\n  new final comment period.  An RFC may be rejected by the core team after public discussion has settled and comments have been made summarizing\n  the rationale for rejection. A member of the core team should then close the RFC's associated pull request.  An RFC may be accepted at the close of its final comment period. A core team member will merge the RFC's associated\n  pull request, at which point the RFC will become 'active'.   If accepted, the  reviewing  PR will be updated to move the RFC to  3-accepted . If not it'll be moved to 5-rejected . Once the RFC has been accepted, anyone (not just the original proposer) can start to implement it. If the RFC is being actively worked on, it'll stay in the  3-accepted  stage.",
