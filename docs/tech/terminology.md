# Terminology #

In most cases we use the same terminology as other charities or non-profits use. We also try and stick to the same
terms as what Stripe uses, but sometimes we use alternative terms if it makes more sense. Here we try and demistify
some of the terms you may see reguarding online donations.

* **One-Off Donation**
    * a single donation by a person
* **Plan**
    * describes how much should be donated and at what interval
* **Recurring Donations**
    * see _Plan_
* **Single Donation**
    * see _One-Off Donation_
* **Subscriber** (aka 'Supporter', 'Donor', 'Friend')
    * the person who donates regularly (ie. has a subscription)
* **Subscription**
    * a promise of a regular payment (described by a _Plan_) from a _Subscriber_
