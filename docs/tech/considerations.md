# Considerations #

Some things to consider prior to using The Donatinator is what kind of installation you want. This may depend on
whether you currently have a website, and what your hosting already provides you. Let's split this up to make some
decisions easier.

## Is your current site secure (SSL enabled)? ##

If not, then you need have a link on your site which points to your secure Donatinator hosting. Whether the Donatinator
is running on a sub-domain of your current domain or it uses the SSL enabled sub-domain of `*.herokuapp.com` or
`*.appspot.com` is also up to you.

**NOTE**: if your current site is not secure, then you shouldn't embed a Donatinator donation form within a page on
your site, since this will still be insecure.

## Do you have current website? ##

Yes/No? If not, you could use The Donatinator as your sole hosting if you only need basic content management.

## Would you like to accept payments through your current site? ##

If yes, then you'll need to decide how to integrate the Donatinator. Since the Donatiantor is a standalone app, then
you can either link directly to the Donatinator for the donors use, or you can embed a donation form on your
site. (Note: you can only embed a form if your current hosting is secure.)
