# The Donatinator

The Donatinator is an open-source web application to help you accept One-Off or Recurring Donations for your charity or
non-profit. It is written in nodejs, uses Postgres, and can be hosted on your own server, Heroku, AppEngine, and many
other hosting sites. It uses Stripe for payment processing.

A demo site can be seen at [donatinator.herokuapp.com](https://donatinator.herokuapp.com/).
