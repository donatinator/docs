# Contributing #

We use a standard fork, branch, commit, push, merge-request model on our repositories hosted on GitLab.

We also mirror our code on GitHub but issues and pull-requests are not accepted there, however you may fork our repo on
there if it is easier for you to do so.

## Process ##

In general it is best to open an issue prior to starting work on a new feature or bug. Once done you'll have an issue
number to group your work under.

ToDo.

## Repositories ##

* [donatinator](https://gitlab.com/donatinator/donatinator) - the server code needed to run your own donor portal
* [docs](https://gitlab.com/donatinator/docs) - documentation related to any part of this project
* [rfcs](https://gitlab.com/donatinator/rfcs) - RFCs for large change-requests

## Communication ##

Currently we hang out in #donatinator on Freenode but we do not have a forum or mailing list set up yet. Please let us
know if you would like to see either of these things happen.

## License

By contributing to The Donatinator, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as
