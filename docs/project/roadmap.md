# RoadMap #

Whilst we think the Donatinator is already great at managing and accepting donations online, we also believe there is a
long way to go to make it truly useful to all kinds of organisations.

## Soon : 1-3 months ##

* more docs
* **campaigns** - run a specific campaign such as a Christmas Campaign, or to raise funds for a piece of equipment
* **fundraising** - allow anyone (e.g. someone you helped) to start a fundraiser (e.g. 10km walk) and accept donations from their friends and family

Also see the [Near Term](https://gitlab.com/donatinator/donatinator/milestones/3) milestone in GitLab.

## Medium Term : 3-6 months ##

* ability for your donors to log in and manage their subscriptions

Also see the [Medium Term](https://gitlab.com/donatinator/donatinator/milestones/4) milestone in GitLab.

## Long Term : 6-12 months ##

* ToDo
