Thanks.

Welcome to the docs repository for [The Donatinator](https://donatinator.org).

Whilst we use [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) for hosting our docs repository, we also mirror the code to GitHub.

## Contributing ##

We welcome any pull-requests / changesets to improve our documentation. We use [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to
generate our code, but you shouldn't include a generated update in your pull request. Please only include the changes
to the MarkDown file(s) (inside the `docs/` dir) or site setup (the `mkdocs.yml` file) and no changes inside the
`html/` dir.

At an appropriate time, we'll regenerate the docs and push to the static site hosting we use.
